## What is it? ##
This website is the final project for the Web3102 class at NSCC.  It is a java servlet, SQL Database built to resemble an financial planning webapp.
This allows you to do things, like log income and expenses, track you investments and set up reoccuring payments.


This system is supposed to look like an older financial planning software, kind of like 1980's- 1990s's vibes with weird bordered boxes and big text on white back grounds
